In order to conduct a search, the user must enter the desired information, in the correct format, into the search bar located in the left hand side of the webpage (Figure 1). If one wants to filter their search to a specific city, one would only need to enter the name of the city into the city search bar and the webpage will comb through the Java Script file and output results from city specified. For example, in Figure 2, the city of willow was entered into the search bar, and two results for the city came up.
